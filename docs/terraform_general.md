# Terraform general

## Tools

For local development, you need a few things:

- [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html) - which manages multiple runtime versions;
- [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html) - which augments existing shells with a new feature that can load and unload environment variables.

All these tools must be installed and configured according to their official documentation.

### asdf

The config file `.tool-versions` is located in the root directory. The structure is very straightforward.

```shell
terraform 1.2.9
terraform-docs 0.16.0
tflint 0.40.0
pre-commit 2.20.0
```

The complete package list is in the [.tool-versions](.tool-versions) file.

Before we install the tools, we need to add the plugins:

```shell
asdf plugin add terraform
asdf plugin add terraform-docs
asdf plugin add tflint
asdf plugin add pre-commit
```

To install the required tools, run the command as in the example below.

```shell
asdf install
```

**Important**: Please keep in mind the versions or tools themselves might change, so it is advised to rerun `asdf install` command after pulling from git.

After the installation process, all the tools will be installed. You can verify this by executing.

```shell
% terraform --version
Terraform v1.2.9
on darwin_amd64
```

in the project directory.

More information and examples can be found in the ASDF project [documentation](https://asdf-vm.com/manage/plugins.html).

### direnv

The direnv config files `.envrc` might be present in many directories.
So, you'll need to approve each of them by entering a particular directory whenever their contents change.

**Notice**: The descriptive error will pop up if you forget to do so.

To allow direnv to load its config run:

```shell
% direnv allow
direnv: loading .envrc
direnv: export ~PATH
```
**Notice**: output will vary depending on the directory in which you run it.

### Pre-commit hooks

The repository has `pre-commit` hooks configured:

```yaml
repos:
  # Pre-commit hooks

```

The full hooks list can be found in the [.pre-commit-config.yaml](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file.

**Important**: We're using **GitHub Actions** to trigger `pre-commit` checks on the **Pull Request**. The configuration file can be found in the in the [static-code-analysis.yml](.github/workflows/static-code-analysis.yml) file.

## Versioning

The module should be tagged using SemVer and a changelog. Use the [semantic commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to auto-generate the changelog.

## Repository structure

The diagram below shows a typical Terraform module repo structure. To avoid reinventing the wheel, we adopted the [schema](https://www.terraform.io/language/modules/develop/structure) proposed by the Terraform team.
